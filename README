        Implement
            CREATE TABLE (PRIMARY KEY)
            DROP TABLE
    
            INSERT INTO 
            UPDATE
            DELETE FROM

            SELECTION
            PROJECTION
            RENAMING
            SET UNION
            SET DIFFERENCE
            CROSS PRODUCT

    Do not use the source code files in the "root" folder; use the capitalized source code files in /RDMBS/RDBMS/RDBMS.
